      Hello My name is Carol, <br>

      I'm new to Software Development and currently learning C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
      Honestly, programming can be confusing frequently, but I'm working through it step by step.
      I have fun problem-solving (when I know how to solve the problem!) and seeking to find ways
      to learn and solve how things work in code.

      <br>

      Right now, my focus is on building and solidifying my programming logic and improving my
      skills as well. I don't have experience yet, but I'm excited to keep learning and increase my knowledge!

      <br>
